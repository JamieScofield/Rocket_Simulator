## Rocket Simulator
# WARNING CURRENTLY IN BETA NO WORKING RELEASE!!
# Intro
This is an ongoinng personal project to make a 2D simulator to simulate a rocket launch from the ground.
The project plan is to make a simulation where the user can input what variables they want to rocket to be (mass, velocity, fuel ect) and see the outcome of these results in a graph 
Currently the project is being made in Pyhton3 due to the use of libraries such as Numpy and Matplotlib though this can be assessed in the future.
